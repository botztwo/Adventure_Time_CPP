Important c++ information 
-In Itinerary.cpp we have a working put_in_global_mem( ) and get_from_global_mem( ). These functions are used to put entire objects in global mem and then retrieve them. 
-Itinerary Objects use Date objects and Day objects as members of their class. 
-If Register function does not work, use
 Username: help 
 Password:please 
-To get into the next page. These login credentials will act like a masterkey just so anyone who needs to can get in without typing in all their information or if something goes wrong. 
-Socials Class in Login.cpp has been produced but not implemented. 
-Global_mem memory is used fully for one full process of adding a user and a trip. 
-Unused variables will come up at the makefile but these were variables that would assist us in creating more functionality and could not use.
